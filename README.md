# forward-forward

Experimenting with the forward-foward algorithm based on https://keras.io/examples/vision/forwardforward/, 
implementing Geoffrey Hinton's paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345


Having built a working FF MLP, next is 
attempting to build an image classifier using a pretrained CNN (Mobilenet_v2),
build a forward-foward classifier head.
